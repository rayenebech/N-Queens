# N-Queens
Implementation of N-Queens Problem in C language

A classic example of backtracking algorithms is “N Queens Problem”. It was first introduced in 1848 with N = 8 Queens. The first solution was proposed in 1850 by Franz Nauck. Since then, this 8 Queens puzzle and its generalized N-Queen version have attracted more researchers to develop better and optimized solutions.Here, we will go through the working principle of backtracking in solving this problem and  its implementation in C language. We will also analyze its time complexity (Big O notation). 
The N Queen Algorithm searches for a safe arrangement of N chess queen on a chessboard with N*N dimensions  such that no queen attacks any other. A queen is in danger if it is in the same line or column or diagonal with another queen. This means every queen should be placed in a unique row and unique column with paying attention to the diagonals
 Here is an example of 4*4 Chessboard with a safe arrangement of 4 Queens:
